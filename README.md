Features 
-------- 
* **Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment (FR-IQA)** 
	* Predicts perceptual quality scores aligned with human judgments. 
	* Outputs both a global MOS score and a spatial visibility map for distortion localization. 
	* Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with a lightweight, multiscale CNN.
	* Trained using pseudo-MOS labels, eliminating the need for large-scale human annotation.
* **Latent-Space Optimization and Perceptual Loss**
	* Operates directly on VAE-encoded latent representations to guide diffusion-based pipelines.
	* Provides perceptually aligned optimization without repeated decoding into image space.
	* Enables curriculum learning: first restores less critical regions, then focuses on perceptually salient areas.
	* Improves performance in tasks such as denoising, super-resolution, and face restoration.


Usage 
----- 

To run the MILO metric, first clone this repository. Then simply execute:

```bash
python MILO_runner.py --ref images/ref.png --dist images/dist.png
```

* `--ref` : Path to the reference image 
* `--dist`: Path to the distorted/test image 

The output score indicates the perceptual difference: 
* **Score of 0** â†’ perceptually identical images (no visible distortions)
* **Score of 1** â†’ highest possible disruption; extreme perceptible distortions in the test image (compared to the reference)

To run the MILO latent metric:

```bash
python MILO_runner_latent.py --ref latents/ref.npy --dist latents/dist.npy
```

The .npy files contain the latent space representation of the reference and distorted images.
